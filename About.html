      <div class="inroduce-text">Hi I am Levi Lv Meiyi, an aspiring programmer stepping into the professional world. I
        love playing basketball
        and
        staying active, and I enjoy working in teams. I am familiar with Java, JavaScript, C, Python, as well as Linux
        and MySQL.
        I like exploring new technologies, sharing knowledge, and bringing energy and enthusiasm into everything I do.

        <ul>
          I didn't start my journey as a programmer with a clear plan. At first, it was simply curiosity — wanting to
          understand
          what happens behind the screen. Gradually, that curiosity turned into practice, and practice slowly became a
          habit.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          I enjoy building things from scratch and embracing the challenges that come with debugging and failure. During
          this
          process, I met Xiaoyun Li, Xinshuo Ji, Wei Li, Wangzi Chen, Bo Qu, and Chang Wei. To me, they have been more
          than
          classmates or collaborators; they are friends, even like family.
          Programming, for me, is more than writing code. It's a way to train my thinking, solve problems, and cultivate
          patience.
        </ul>
        <ul></ul>
        <ul>
          As for this blog, the idea started simply — I wanted a space to document my learning, my thought process, and
          my
          growth.
          It doesn't need to be perfect; it just needs to be honest and allow me to move forward consistently. Yet for a
          long
          time, I didn't have a clear direction.

          Everything changed during my internship at Boeing, where I met Eric, a returnee from studying abroad. He gave
          me
          unprecedented inspiration. During our time together, he helped me strengthen the areas I was weak in, shared
          experiences
          and ways of thinking that books never teach, and showed me the depth of his own abilities. His influence
          prompted me to
          reconsider what I wanted to create and leave behind.
        </ul>
        Finally, I sincerely thank everyone who has helped me along the way, and my parents for their unwavering
        support. Thank
        you all for allowing me to continue moving forward on this path.
